# 📘 C-LANGUAGE-DSA
## C Programming & Data Structures Practice Repository

This repository contains **C language programs and Data Structures implementations** created during hands-on learning and practice using **GitHub Codespaces** and local development.  
It covers **core C concepts**, **pointers**, **structures**, and **fundamental data structures** such as **arrays, linked lists, and queues**.

All programs are written in **pure C**, compiled using `gcc`, and focused on **concept clarity and low-level understanding**.

## 🎯 Objectives of This Repository

- Strengthen fundamentals of **C programming**
- Understand **memory, pointers, and structures**
- Implement **Data Structures from scratch**
- Practice **linked list operations**
- Learn **queue implementation using linked list**
- Maintain structured and version-controlled learning code
